// The lookup key for both AI-reply lookaside tables: the global filter (aiFilterRepo) and the

// Deliberately minimal: case, surrounding space, repeated space. In particular it does NOT use
// shared/Normalization.js's homoglyph folding, which exists to defeat deliberate banned-word
// obfuscation and is far too aggressive here - it would collapse genuinely different questions
// onto one another, and the cost of that mistake is the bot answering a real question with a
// canned line meant for something else.
